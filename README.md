## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter an issue like `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './assets/adaptive-icon.png'`, make sure the `adaptive-icon.png` exists in the `assets` folder and is correctly referenced in your `app.json` file.

- Clear the Expo cache:

  ```bash
  expo start -c
  ```

- If dependencies fail to install, try deleting `node_modules` and reinstalling:

  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
  npm install
  ```

- For other errors, consult the [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/).
